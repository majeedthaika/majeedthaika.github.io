Just tried self-learning basic Web development with the help of the following tutorials:
1. https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/
2. http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#

My goals from this project are:
1. Create an `aesthetically-pleasing` website.
2. Serve as a platform to learn/polish my skills with `Haskell`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Ruby`.
3. To have a personal website to document my thoughts and day-to-day projects.
