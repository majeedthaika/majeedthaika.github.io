_**"Actively doing Nothing"**_ - that was the informal job description of being Scrum Master. What does that even mean???

Since I was neither an expert in _'Agile values'_, nor very knowledgeable in the technical aspects of our project (I had, like the rest of the team, not even heard of Lua before the start of this project), I had no clue on how I should be a good Scrum Master - I've always worked best behind the keyboard, where I'm in my comfort zone.

So, like every other time I had no idea what I was doing, I just consulted my best friend... _Google_! One of the first results I got was a forum in www.scrum.com, titled "What does a Scrum Master do all day?" - Glad to know I wasn't the only one who was clueless about the role.

Reading the posts, I learned that one of the main duties of a Scrum Master is to aid in **'Organizational Transformation'** - a fancy way to say that they will help smoothen the Scrum adoption of a team from being more traditional to a more _Agile team_. This can be done by preaching the _'Agile values'_ and helping out implement the periodic **Sprints**. However, since we had adopted the Scrum model for a couple of Sprints already, we didn't need too much insight into the Agile way, so instead I chose to focus on the big feature of a Scrum Master: Coaching and _causing any change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team_.

Specifically, I wanted to target the more 'underperforming' members of our team - the ones who I felt had more potential than what they had contributed thus far. I started with my roommate, PJ. In case I haven't mentioned it before, we had made a choice to use the Corona framework in Lua since it offers nice simulating feedback on a range of Android/iOS phones on top of a pretty straightforward language. The problem? PJ only has Linux on his laptop, which is uncompatible with the Corona Labs Application. He tried dual-booting Windows on his laptop, but that proved to be too complicated and time-consuming.

While seeing PJ struggle, I remembered him previously making a comment on how he was bewildered that his brother disliked the MacBook that he bought, and rarely uses it nowadays. So, I suggested the most simplest thing I thought of: _"Why don't you ask your brother for his Mac until the end of the term?"_ Though it might seem obvious in hidsight, the thought never occured to him previously. PJ immediately messaged his brother, and after a quick phone call, his brother not only lent him the MacBook, but **gifted PJ the MacBook outright**! And just like that PJ's ability to contribute to the project went up boatloads. Not bad for my first day as Scrum Master!

_More to follow soon..._
